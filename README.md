# The Odin Project

## Improved Todo

A todo list application created using Webpack, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Try it out at https://jordanmichb.github.io/improved-todo/

Create projects and add tasks that can then be edited or deleted. Projects and tasks are stored in local storage so they will persist through page refreshes. Expand each tasks to see the parent project, the full title, and a description. Sort tasks by filtering for all, tasks due today, tasks due within the week, or tasks that have been marked completed.
